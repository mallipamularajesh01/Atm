ATM Management System – Python (OOPS)

Name: M. Rajesh
PIN Number: 25B25A4417

Introduction:
This project is a simple ATM Management System created using Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts. 
The main idea behind this project is to understand how real-life ATM operations can be converted into Python code 
in a clear and structured way. This program works in a command-line environment and interacts with the user 
through a menu, just like a real ATM machine.

What I Understood from This Project:
By working on this project, I understood how OOPS concepts are applied in practical programs. 
I learned how abstraction helps in defining common behavior, how inheritance allows one class to use another class’s properties, 
and how encapsulation protects sensitive data like account balance. This project also improved my logical thinking 
and confidence in writing Python programs.

What This Project Does:
The ATM system allows the user to:
- Check their account balance
- Deposit money into the account
- Withdraw money with proper validation
- View account details
- Exit the ATM safely

All operations are handled using methods inside classes, which makes the code clean and easy to understand.

Conclusion:
This ATM Management System project is very useful for beginners learning Python and OOPS. 
It clearly explains how theoretical concepts can be used in real applications. 
Completing this project helped me gain hands-on experience and prepared me for developing more advanced projects in the future.
